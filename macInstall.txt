Installing flyeye on a mac can be painful. I give no guarantees that the following procedure works, but it seems to be a possibility. This guide is probably incomplete, feel free to add anything to it.

General warning: Please, if you try to use homebrew and pip and something doesnt work, dont let yourself be guided into using Macports or Fink. Using multiple package managers leads straight to hell.

0a) install Xcode from the mac App store, or alternatively register as an Apple developer and get the command line tools for your version here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads

0b) Install GCC: follow the instructions at
https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/HUGG/Installing+the+GNU+compilers+on+Mac+OS+X
It might be possible to install gcc by something like 'brew install gcc' after step 1. I didn't try, but feel free to try.

1) Install Homebrew
   after installing, type in the terminal:
	- brew update
	- brew doctor

2) Install python using: 
	- brew install python


3) You need to make sure the terminal uses the new version of python. go to your home folder and use a text editor to change the file '.bash_profile' (if it doesn't exist yet, create it, and add the line
"PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin" ). You need to tell it where to look for python. If you installed python via homebrew, add a line somewhere like

export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/python/<version>/bin:$PATH

where <version> is the python version you installed (in my case: 2.7.7_2).


4) Close the terminal and open a new one. Your new version of python came with pip. We will use pip to install a number of modules. Enter the following lines in the terminal:
 	- pip install ipython

Again, you will need to tell the terminal where to find these packages. Open .bash_profile again (its in your home folder) and add a line:
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
If you have a different python version, of course substitute the correct number.

 	- pip install numpy
	- pip install scipy
		This takes a while. Grab a coffee.
	- brew install pkg-config (This is needed to get matplotlib to install without problems)
 	- pip install matplotlib (a great library for plotting your data!)
 	- pip install pillow (google this if it doesnt work)
	

5) You can now test your python packages from step 4 by trying to import them in ipython. Open ipython (type 'ipython' in the terminal) and then type statements like:
import numpy
If no error is generated, your package installed correctly. Try all installed packages, and also try 'import Tkinter'



6) Install a current version of ffmpeg by typing "brew install ffmpeg" in a terminal
	if you get errors that ffmpeg cannot be linked to the local folder, get permission to that folder by typing 'sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local', and then 'brew link ffmpeg'



7) Now the hard part: installing opencv. First make the brewing formula available: In a terminal, type 
	- brew tap homebrew science' 
Then, the most important step:
	- brew install -vd -tbb opencv
		- if libpng needs to be linked: do as in step 6. First type 'sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local', and then 'brew link libpng'
This might take a few minutes. Get a coffee.


8) Python needs to be able to find your installation of opencv, which is in a different path from the stuff you installed via pip in step 4. Once more, open .bash_profile in your homefolder, and add a line ABOVE the previous PYTHONPATH line like:
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.9/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
(correct for your version of opencv and python)

In ipython, you can try if your opencv installation worked by typing:
import cv, cv2


9) Copy some version of flyeyeball to anywhere you like, and open it from the terminal by typing 'python minimal.py'
 PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
