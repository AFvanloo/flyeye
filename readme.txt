INSTALLATION INSCTRUCTIONS
############################################

The installation is systems specific, and therefore here I will describe what to install. How to install the parts on your specific system 
For most steps you will need administrator permissions

1) Install Python (Comes pre-installed on must Linux and Max distributions)
2) Install Ipython (the python interpreter)

3) Install the following python packages. How to do that depends on your operating system, but in many cases it can be done via pip (google python pip)
    - Tkinter (might be pre-installed on your system with python)
    - numpy (might also be pre-installed)
    - PIL. Alternatively, pillow might work, but this has not been tested
    - Matplotlib

4) Install OpenCV. How to get the python bindings for openCV to work once again depends on your system, so google 'install openCV-python <operating system>'
